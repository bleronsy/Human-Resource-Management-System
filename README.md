# Human-Resource-Management-System
A small database, although complete. A human resource management database.
I have created a database for a store.
The purpose of this database is to create an interface for retrieving information about employees, employee trainings, employee holidays, company suppliers, discount offers, products etc.
Some business rules are: 
  1) Every sales point in managed by a manager, but one manager manages only one sale point.
  2) Every employee can be a manager
  3) Every sales point has a lot of employees, but an employee can only work in one sale point
  4) Every sales point has a lot of cashiers, store-keepers, sectorists
  5) A discount is valid for all sales points
